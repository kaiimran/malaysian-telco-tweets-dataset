# malaysian-telco-tweets-dataset
Malaysian tweets about maxis, umobile, celcom, unifi, digi, internet, yes, 4g, sim, prepaid, tmconnects

Raw data (StreamTwitDB) is from: https://github.com/AsyrafAzlan/SentiLexM/issues/2#issuecomment-819435428

My job here is to clean the data as you can see in the Jupyter Notebook:
[https://nbviewer.org/github.com/kaiimran/malaysian-telco-tweets-dataset/blob/main/telco_tweet_analysis.ipynb
](https://nbviewer.org/github/kaiimran/malaysian-telco-tweets-dataset/blob/main/telco_tweet_analysis.ipynb)

Reduced the dataset size from 185.6 MB to 6.7 MB by removing duplicates, unnecessary columns, and non-Malaysian languages.
Thus, deduplicated_telco_tweet.csv contains 36,253 tweets.
